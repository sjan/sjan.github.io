<p>After Prague we pointed southeast and landed in Brno. We were searching for somewhere to leave Judy&#8217;s and Tom&#8217;s bags, so we don&#8217;t have to haul them all along the silk route. This is where Vranovice, Czech Republic comes in&#8230; Vranovice is a small town in Bohemia of less than 1,000 people, and it&#8217;s where we left our bags. The Helikar family saved the day. Tom&#8217;s friend Vojta is from the big V, and Vojta spent a year in Omaha in high school. We worked at St. Mary magdalene church together back in the usher glory days. I had been to Vranovice before when I visited Vojta over Easter weekend three years ago.&nbsp;  We rolled through fields of sunflowers, past small Czech towns and into Vranovice. I knew Vojta&#8217;s parents lived in the same road as the church, so we found the church and I tried to guess which house it was&#8230; I could not remember exactly what it looked like but had an idea. Unsure, I stepped up one porch and gave the door a knock. A scruffy man answered and I knew he wasn&#8217;t mr. Helikar, the mayor of the town. The man gave me a clueless look and I waved, said thank you in Czech and moved on. Eventually I asked a young woman walking with her baby if she knew where the Helikar house was.&nbsp;I found it and spoke with the helikars about leaving our bags, gave them chocolates, and headed off to Hungary.<&#47;p></p>
