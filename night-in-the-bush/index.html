I forget their names but they&rsquo;d been back and forth between Belgium and Mali several times and had extensive experience with the roads there. I opened up my map and showed them our route: east toward Kiffa, south at Ayoun toward Nioro, South again towards Bamako. They took a look and marked up our map pointing out which roads were good, which were bad, and which roads despite being on the map, didn&rsquo;t exist. They introduced us to some really awesome scenic routes around Mali and it was reassuring to hear that Malians are among the most welcoming people.<&#47;p>

At 6:00 PM, 150 km from Kiffa, we stopped for the evening. Once again, Team Last Responders lagged behind. We&nbsp; spent the night at the side of the road and dined on our favorite food: instant noodles, canned tuna, and Heinz beans. <img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="http:&#47;&#47;stephenjan.files.wordpress.com&#47;2012&#47;02&#47;img_5556-1024x683.jpg" width="640" height="427"><&#47;p> </p>
