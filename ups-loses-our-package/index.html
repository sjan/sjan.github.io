<p align="justify">Day 21 in Dakhla. I checked the UPS tracker this morning and the site reported that the package for which we have been waiting was &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo;. This is despite phone calls from New Jersey, New York, and even the Western Sahara. Now I have no idea whether it&rsquo;s fault of UPS, Moroccan Post, or both. We paid a pretty penny to have this stuff shipped over so I am expecting this shit to either arrive or our money back. Colin was convinced after seeing that last line that someone in Casablanca had stolen the package.<&#47;p>
<p align="justify">As of this morning, we&rsquo;ve sent some &ldquo;locals&rdquo; to the UPS office in Casablanca to sort it out. Hopefully there will be lots of blood shed.<&#47;p></p>
