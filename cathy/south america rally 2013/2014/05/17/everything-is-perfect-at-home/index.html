<p>1.&nbsp; We were all rushed onto the plane in Lima, and I had to use the bathroom before the plane took off.&nbsp; I was so very happy that the toilet paper can be flushed down the toilet.<&#47;p>
<p>2.&nbsp; By the time we landed in Florida, everybody spoke English,&nbsp; I understood every word of every conversation, all the signs were familiar too.<&#47;p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It took about 3 minutes to re-connect my cellphone.&nbsp; I got my unlimited LTE network back while waiting for my connecting flight.<&#47;p>
<p>4.&nbsp; When I finally arrived in Baltimore and met my mom at the baggage claim, my first word was, &ldquo;mama.&rdquo;&nbsp; My mom said, &ldquo;Oh, you didn&rsquo;t lose any weight.&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I slept on my full size bed with soft clean sheets I chose and purchased to my liking.&nbsp; I have my own bed, my own bedroom, my own bathroom, my own study, no need to share anymore.<&#47;p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I showered as long as I wanted, applied conditioner on my hair and even had a facial mask.&nbsp; The next day, I showered twice, in fact, I can shower as many times as I want.<&#47;p>
<p>7.&nbsp; I have plenty of clean clothes.<&#47;p>
<p>8.&nbsp; 回家后第一顿饭吃的是凉瓜，皮蛋拌豆腐等清爽的小菜。吃饭的时候，面上无事，心里很感慨呀。然后第二天买了一条活鱼回来，总算吃到了真正的新鲜鱼。<&#47;p>
<p>9.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll get to see all of you who supported us.&nbsp; Thank you for everything.<&#47;p></p>
