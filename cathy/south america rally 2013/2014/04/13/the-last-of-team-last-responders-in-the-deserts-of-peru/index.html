As the team headed out of Trujillo, Martha wanted to put the extra Jeep keys on her keychain, forgetting that we left the Jeep behind; when entering a crowded city, Cathy looked into the side mirror of the ambulance to see whether the Jeep was following, also forgetting the Jeep was no longer there; Steve, well, Steve has been focusing on an iPhone game and has not yet had the leisure to express his emotions.<&#47;span><&#47;span></p>
