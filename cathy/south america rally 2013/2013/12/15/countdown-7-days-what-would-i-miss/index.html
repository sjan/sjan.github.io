<p>7 days before launching, I'm asking myself what I would be missing from New York.&nbsp; My bed came to mind first.&nbsp; In 2008, I had been a traveling consultant for almost a year, I saved a bunch of money by subletting my apartment and not paying for food, I slept in my own bed for less than a fortnight in all the months traveled.&nbsp; Honestly, I prefer my own firm mattress and silk bedding better than 4 or 5 star hotels.</p>
<p>Friends and family are gonna be missed.</p>
<p>Food? Maybe not so much... New York City offers the largest number of varieties in America, but everything is Americanized.&nbsp; In my opinion, if Chinese food rates 100% in China, the best Chinese food in New York rates about 75%; Italian food in New York is at 70% when compared to food made Italy.&nbsp; I don't know how much good food we'll be able to find and afford on the road, but I'm looking forward to authentic Latin food.</p>
<p>Instant data connectivity would be lost on the road.&nbsp; I've been playing an online game on my cellphone almost every waking hour of everyday during the past 6 months, sigh...</p>
<p>What other luxuries would I miss in New York?&nbsp; Walking distance to everything I need has always been a huge plus.&nbsp; Having supreme dragon-well tea in my favorite cup in the perfect water temperature wouldn't be possible anymore.&nbsp; The funny thing is, I would miss my tea, but I wouldn't miss my single molt scotch, I'm looking forward to rum already.&nbsp; Well, forget about the tea, having time to myself seems very unlikely on the road, humm... maybe that's what I'll be missing the most.</p>
