<p>About 9 months ago, on March 8th, to my dear diary, I wrote "I'm determined to go to South America... It will happen because I'm determined to to so" Since then, I never had a day with any doubts.&nbsp; Like any intensive teamwork, there were times for disagreements, arguments, and even disappointments, but there was never been any hesitation for me.&nbsp; 9 months is a long time, in the amount of time a baby could have been delivered, we accomplished many milestones as a team, and personally, I have learned many important lessons in dealing with people.</p>
<p>In February, we started with a roomful of people talking about what would be a good journey.&nbsp; People had wild suggestions ranging from the silk road to the southernmost tip of South America. The next step was to define a charitable mission and then decide on a type of vehicle.&nbsp; In short, we pulled off many fundraising events, generated media coverage, searched for sponsors, applied for grants, built three iterations of a website, and purchased and painted our beloved ambulance.</p>
<p>10 days from launching, our coworkers generously threw a sendoff lunch for us.</p>

<p>With 10 days to go, I already set a resignation date with my current workplace, my apartment has been sublet out, and I packed half of my stuff.</p>
<p>With 10 days to go, team last responders still has open issues</p>
<ul>
<li>Ambulance repair is still in progress<&#47;li>
<li>No final decision on a support vehicle - In addition to the ambulance, a supporting vehicle is needed for this group of 7, we looked at some sedans and SUVs, but we haven't decided which vehicle to purchase.&nbsp; We need to purchase, register, and perform necessary repairs on the supporting vehicle.<&#47;li>
<li>Visa not obtained &ndash; Everyone needs a Bolivian visa, applications are not submitted yet.<&#47;li>
<li>Website is still in progress<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now is there any doubt in mind?&nbsp; Absolutely not.&nbsp; We have achieved so much as a team, there is no doubt that we'll overcome whatever&nbsp;hurdles on our extraordinarily expedition.</p>
