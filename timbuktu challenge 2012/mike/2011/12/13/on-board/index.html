<p>It's almost four years since I've flown overseas. At least two years too long. I'm sitting in Seat 32C on British Airways Flight 66. It's a Boeing 777, large enough to have two aisles, but at least a third of the seats are empty. An English fellow keeps trading seats with people in order that he might make his kids more comfortable somehow.</p>
<p>For dinner there was lasagna, salad, and banana cake. I must confess I quite enjoy airplane food. It's efficiency never fails to impress me; all these perfect little meals being produced seemingly out of a cart not much larger than R2-D2. They don't taste half bad either. I'll take airline food over hospital food any day.</p>
<p>Looking around this plane bound for London it's hard to imagine that the end of this journey lies South, past the Sahara, in a place whose name is synonymous with "the middle of nowhere". Timbuktu.</p>
