<p>Thanks everyone for coming to the Launch Party! I feel absolutely lucky to have so many people support us. I look forward to return with an experience of a lifetime and some great stories to tell!&nbsp; Now with the launch party behind me, I have two days to finish my stateside preparations and head to Berlin. I&#8217;m still waiting for my Azerbaijan Visa. Hopefully DC team will pull through and get that to me by tomorrow morning.<&#47;p></p>
