<p>Ever since I made last post about our vehicle two days ago, I&#8217;ve  gotten numerous responses from our fans asking &#8220;Do we get to vote on the  car?&#8221; At first, i thought that that was absolutely silly. But after a  couple beers, a swig of vodka, and coherent rational contemplation, I  decided, why not? I&#8217;ve put up a poll on our vehicle section:<&#47;p></p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mmt2010.org&#47;index.php?Itemid=58"><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mmt2010.org&#47;index.php?Itemid=58">http:&#47;&#47;www.mmt2010.org&#47;index.php?Itemid=58<&#47;a><&#47;a><&#47;p></p>
<p>Please vote!<&#47;p></p>
