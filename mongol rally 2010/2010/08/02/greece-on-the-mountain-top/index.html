<p>After more than two hours of driving around in circles trying to get into Athens, <br &#47;>Stephen and I dropped off Judy and Tom right in front of the Acropolis. We each had<br &#47;>our own missions. Theirs was to find information on the ferry from Athens to izmir,<br &#47;>while ours was to deliver a stretcher we had been given  in Berlin to a place way up<br &#47;>in the Greek mountains, where friends of ours were going to have a festival. We had<br &#47;>no problem at all finding the tiny town, Evrostina half way up the mountain close to<br &#47;>Xylocastro. Despite Greek street signs and crazy Greek car drivers using four lanes<br &#47;>although there were only two, we made good time.<br &#47;><br &#47;>At the local restaurant in Evrostina we even met another group that wanted to go up<br &#47;>the mountain. But before leaving Jorgos, the old German speaking owner of the place,<br &#47;>served us the most delicious Greek food we ever had. Our new friends wanted to drive<br &#47;>up the mountain after they finished their meal, but since we planned to pick up Judy<br &#47;>and Tom in Athens at 8pm we decided not to wait for them to finish their Greek<br &#47;>joghurt and ouzo but to start up the mountain immediately after lunch. They gave us<br &#47;>directions: Drive up the mountain, you&#8217;ll see a sign. Turn left and follow the path<br &#47;>up. From the sign it&#8217;ll take you 15  to 20 minutes to reach your destination. Sounds<br &#47;>easy! So we headed up.<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;picasaweb.google.com&#47;lh&#47;photo&#47;k89VpJvrKQlQ-LQLcvW03Q?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;lh6.ggpht.com&#47;_Ru_El2KH20s&#47;TGFxA8sdpxI&#47;AAAAAAAAAf4&#47;eMrTjxbOWnU&#47;s400&#47;P8013568.JPG" &#47;><&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>The path turned out to be a great preview to the Kasach desert roads waiting for us<br &#47;>further east; A stoney, dusty road, winding up the mountain, so narrow that there<br &#47;>was no space to turn, and a deep cliffside to our left that made our hearts beat<br &#47;>nervously. Nevertheless the beautiful surroundings were breathtaking. From time to time we<br &#47;>stopped to enjoy the view over the valley and the azure ocean, birds chirping in the<br &#47;>background, and took pictures of our ambulance covered in dust. We kept on driving<br &#47;>until we reached a little forest. <br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;picasaweb.google.com&#47;lh&#47;photo&#47;0vEr__-JHkk9f7fEJieohQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;lh3.ggpht.com&#47;_Ru_El2KH20s&#47;TGFw_7uCjQI&#47;AAAAAAAAAfw&#47;jrPEPdRszkY&#47;s400&#47;P8013578.JPG" &#47;><&#47;a><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;picasaweb.google.com&#47;lh&#47;photo&#47;cEcrAYCHHZyHwytohsOL9w?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;lh5.ggpht.com&#47;_Ru_El2KH20s&#47;TGFxAdGqTII&#47;AAAAAAAAAf0&#47;kFAEqMnJi_s&#47;s400&#47;P8013574.JPG" &#47;><&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>We were following the path for over 25 minutes and there was still no evidence of<br &#47;>people. Fearing that we missed a turn, we turned around. We followed several other<br &#47;>paths, driving up and down the mountain, looking for a place that looked like it was<br &#47;>in need of a strecher, before we gave up and rolled back to Evrostina. <br &#47;>Luckily we met another group taking a rest at Jorgos&#8217; restaurant on their way up.<br &#47;>This time we decided to wait for them. 15 minutes later we followed their blue VW<br &#47;>minivan. Unfortunately they were soon out of sight as their car appeared to have a<br &#47;>stronger engine than our heavy Mercedes. After a few minutes of uncertainty we saw<br &#47;>them again, way up, apparently taking the road we took earlier that day. We knew<br &#47;>where to go! <br &#47;><br &#47;>Nevertheless, our attempt to climb the mountain failed again. When we hit a steep<br &#47;>segment, poor old Penny began coughing and rattling, not moving an inch. We were too<br &#47;>heavy. We tried different angles, maneuvering not half a meter away from the steep<br &#47;>cliff. Probably she was just too exhausted after the ups and downs earlier that day.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Hoping to meet a third group we rolled back to Evrostina for the second time.<br &#47;>Meanwhile the preparations for a party had begun. Jorgos and his employees were<br &#47;>preparing gyros and lamb ribs while fat women built up popcorn and dessert stands. A <br &#47;>Chinese couple unpacked immense amounts of toys and a long fold out table out of<br &#47;>their tiny Honda, and neatly arranged plastic guns between barbies and fake watches.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Against our expectations there wasn&#8217;t a third group waiting at Jorgos&#8217; restaurant<br &#47;>just to take us to the mountain top. Since we didn&#8217;t have anything else to do other<br &#47;>than wait, Stephen started a conversation in Mandarin, convincing the Chinese toy<br &#47;>seller to drive us up the mountain after he finished organizing the toys. After<br &#47;>Stephen promised him 50&euro;, he agreed.<br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;picasaweb.google.com&#47;lh&#47;photo&#47;Yn7xHo1LXKLKGAi7p5KQEA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;lh5.ggpht.com&#47;_Ru_El2KH20s&#47;TGFw_a2KyXI&#47;AAAAAAAAAfs&#47;KCUDNvNuaI8&#47;s400&#47;P8013616.JPG" &#47;><&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>While waiting for the barbies to find their place on the table, I sipped Greek<br &#47;>coffee with another old german speaking guy, though I didn&#8217;t really enjoy hearing<br &#47;>his life stories. The sun set, the mountains dissapeard in the dark and I was<br &#47;>nervously checking my phone every fifteen minutes, waiting for Judy to call from<br &#47;>Athens, asking, &#8220;where are you?&#8221; The Chinese toy seller took his time, declining<br &#47;>Stephens more than once offered help.<br &#47;>Finally we loaded the stretcher in his car and started our third attempt to climb<br &#47;>the mountain. While Stephen chatted with the toy seller, getting to know his whole<br &#47;>life story, I was praying for us not to fall off the cliff, as our Chinese driver<br &#47;>had perfectly adopted the Greek driving style, ignoring the waiting depths next to<br &#47;>us, now hidden in the dark.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Finally, at 9&#160;pm, we reached the top of the mountain. A breathtaking amount of stars<br &#47;>awaited us and our surprised friends were sad to hear that we had only ten minutes<br &#47;>to drop off the stretcher before we had to leave again. <br &#47;><br &#47;>Before hitting the road,  we could not resist picking up some of Jorgos&#8217; delicious<br &#47;>lamb ribs, salad, and fresh cut fries. Then we finally started our way back to<br &#47;>Athens to meet Judy and Tom &#8230;only five hours behind schedule.<br &#47;><br &#47;>-Lillie the Kid<&#47;p></p>
