<p>Did you ever read <em>The Borrowers<&#47;em>? The book series lays out a hidden world of tiny folks living alongside and among us, but just beyond our ken. I&rsquo;m continually reminded of this parallel world as we trundle through Central America.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve met many kinds of travelers: Swedish girls enjoying a gap year, retirees happily spending their kids&rsquo; inheritance, Israelis backpacking after their military service, and church groups motoring south to spread the gospel. And of course, we also encounter people on adventures like ours &ndash; driving, motorcycling, or bussing through Latin America.</p>
<p>Yet these varied voyagers are fundamentally similar. All are taking a break from the usual routine to experience something different. At some point we&rsquo;ll go home, back to school or work or family.</p>
<p>And then there are the others. The drifters. They aren&rsquo;t taking an exciting break from regular life. This <em>is<&#47;em> their regular life. They have no plans to stop traveling, riding &ldquo;chicken busses&rdquo; as the whim strikes, surfing, or just meandering from country to country.</p>
<p>Some manage to make their off-the-grid ambling self-sustaining, like the middle aged surfer we met who came south to catch the waves in El Salvador, opened a hostel at a remote beach&hellip;and just hangs out surfing and shmoozing with visitors. Others simply have no long-term expectations, like the young woman who told us she quit her job in advertising, sold her Manhattan apartment, hopped in a car with a guy she&rsquo;d met just a few weeks before, and hasn&rsquo;t looked back. And some are just nomads, like the genial fellow with the Santa Clause beard who stepped out of a bus while we were all stranded at a protest blockade in rural Mexico. He has spent decades wandering up and down the coast from Oregon to Chile.</p>
<p>The decidedly non-luxury, often gritty travel of Team Last Responders has opened a brief window on this semi-hidden subculture of characters. Like <em>The Borrowers<&#47;em>, it has revealed a vast subculture of people who are all around us but in many ways living in a parallel universe.</p>
<p>For my taste, it&rsquo;s not an alluring lifestyle. The joy of a long (or short) voyage is that it offers a stimulating, refreshing break from the norm. A respite from life usual. But When hitting the road or surfing or bunking at hostels is all you do, then not having a routine becomes routine. And then where&rsquo;s the thrill variety and change?</p>
