<p>With Kunal&rsquo;s visa clock ticking, we pushed harder for a follow-up with Hassan about the repairs. Colin made the call. To our extreme disappointment, we learned that the part we were waiting for was in fact <strong>not<&#47;strong> on its way. There was a miscommunication. Hassan hadn&rsquo;t found the transmission filter and was still looking for it.<&#47;p></p>

<p>The realization that we had been waiting for a part that wasn&rsquo;t coming struck a huge blow to morale. We had waited for nothing. I&rsquo;ve been explained that in Africa there is this &ldquo;Inshalla&rdquo; attitude of things happening when &ldquo;God wills it&rdquo;. Perhaps this is an indication that I would never be able to survive in Africa, but I categorically reject it. I picked up the batphone and called Steve Feng at Ivy Lane Auto. <&#47;p></p>
<p>Contacting Steve was pretty challenging. With flakey internet, Skype wasn&rsquo;t working very well. The other option was to use a phone card and pay phone. It took a while to find a working booth &ndash; reminded me of this one guy who said &ldquo;Things in Africa come in 2 conditions: Broken and almost Broken&rdquo;, but I was able to get through to New Jersey.<&#47;p></p>
<p> I presented Steve a description of the transmission problem and the solution that Hassan had come up with. I needed him to send me transmission fluid and a replacement transmission filter. He thought about it and came back with more questions to which that I didn&rsquo;t have answers. It was at this moment that I came to the angering realization that I completely dropped the ball.<br />
