           <p>Meanwhile…</p>

<p><img src="/img/2010-mongolrally/timeline/24-mongolrally-timeline.jpg" alt="Greece" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Lillie and Stephen dropped Tom and me off in a parking lot at the Acropolis. We
agreed to meet in that exact spot in nine hours promptly at eight o’clock pm. “Nine
hours,” we all repeated “no one be late.” We agreed that in a dire emergency we
would call Lillie’s cell phone since she is the only one with a functioning phone at
all.</p>

<p>Tom and I rushed off practically skipping down the roads of the Acropolis to Athens’
center excited about the prospect of a day of exploration after being cooped up in
Penny for days on end. We had also been charged with a mission: find out if we could
somehow ferry across the sea with Penny from Athens to Turkey. With nine hours to
accomplish our mission, however, we decided we needed to fortify ourselves with some
traditional Greek food first. We settled on a small bistro called “Smile” that
advertised inexpensive lunch specials which included wine. The food was delicious
and abundant, as we had come to expect in Greece, and the manager of the restaurant
was a warm and talkative hostess. In fact, she had lived in Chicago for quite some
time and, to Tom’s surprise, knew Notre Dame well.</p>

<p>After our meal, we turned to accomplishing our mission in earnest. First we tried
finding some travel agencies, but they were all closed because it was Sunday. We
decided a fancy hotel would be the next best place to ask. We stopped at the first
large hotel we came across, and inquired with the receptionist about a ferry to
Turkey. She said she could look into it and get back to us if we would tell her our
room number. “We actually aren’t staying here” I said, expecting her to turn us away without any new information. However, she didn’t skip a beat before suggesting that
if we could wait half an hour she would look into it anyway. We happily complied,
deciding to pass the time over coffee at the rooftop restaurant. The restaurant had
a magnificent view of the Acropolis and the city center sprawled below. Tom and I
agreed while gazing at the vista surrounding us that this coffee may have been the
best one we ever drank while looking at the acropolis. When we finished our coffee
we headed back to the reception desk. The receptionist was able to give us some
information, but it was clear that further investigation would be necessary. We
decided we had to head to the port city to get definitive information. We thanked
the receptionist profusely stumbling over the Greek “efharetso.”</p>

<p>We bought bus tickets at one of the many kiosks lining the streets and boarded the
bus to Peirias. It was easy to find since many of the passengers on the bus were
wearing bathing suits and obviously heading in the same direction. After speaking to
several travel agencies at the port, the news was disappointing. There was a boat
leaving the next evening, but there was only one space left and we would have to
book it right away, which meant we could not consult our teammates. The ferry would
take nearly an entire day to reach Izmir, Turkey leaving hours of driving until we
reached Istanbul and would cost us nearly five hundred dollars to transport our team
and Penny. Clearly this was not going to be an option. We would have to retrace our
rout all the way back through Greece which meant at least an extra ten hours on the
road before reaching Turkey.</p>

<p>Tom and I headed back to Athens. Our mission accomplished, we had the rest of the
day to ourselves. We headed to parliament to see the changing of the guard, a highly
stylized and laborious affair overseen by a regular army enlisted man who
periodically straightened the guards kilt like costumes and wiped the sweat off
their faces. We ran over to the old olympic stadium to snap some pictures and to the
royal palace gardens for a short stroll. It was close to seven pm so we decided to
make our way toward the Acropolis again.</p>

<p>While walking in the direction of the Acropolis, Tom suddenly exclaimed “hey!” I
looked up. It was one of our classmates from Washington College of Law, Brian
Kotick. We were stunned! We were in a rush to reach the Acropolis, but he gave us
his cell number and we agreed to try to meet for drinks later. Once at the base, we
circled around the winding roads looking for the parking lot where Lillie and
Stephen left us that morning. In our excitement to get to the city center, Tom and I
had not bothered to write a street name or memorize the location of the lot. After
our second circle around the base I began to fear we would be late. We started
asking random street vendors and shopkeepers if they knew where this parking lot was
located. “It’s the parking lot where the tour buses park at the Acropolis,” we
vaguely explained. No one had any idea what we were talking about. Tom and I were
now moving around the spiraling road of the base at a half jog sweating profusely in
the scalding heat. There was no way we would find it before eight pm this way. We
decided to start retracing our steps throughout the day beginning at the hotel. We
made our way to the hotel which was quite a distance away at this point. Together we
retraced every turn and pause we had taken throughout the day alternating between a
slow jog when we were unsure of our direction and a dead run when we were. We
finally found the parking lot dehydrated and exhausted. It was nearly nine o’clock
and there was no sign of Penny. They couldn’t have left us after merely forty
minutes we reasoned. THEY must be late. Tom and I sat on the curb watching the sun
set over the ruins. “I bet you a beer they are half an hour late.” I said. Tom bet
me a beer they would be an hour late. We were both wrong.</p>

<p>After waiting an hour we started to get worried. Tom went up to a random man in the
parking lot and asked him if he happened to have seen an ambulance pull up in the
last two hours. He looked at Tom with utter confusion and answered that he had not.
But the man began talking to us. We explained what we were doing in Athens and why
we were worried about our team mates. The man offered to let us use his phone to
call Lillie despite the expense of calling a long distance number! When I got her
on the phone I could not quite figure out what had happened but I understood they
would be at least three hours late. We quickly arranged a new rallying point in
front of parliament so Tom and I did not have to sit on the curb for three more
hours. We thanked the man for his generosity and made our way back to the city
center.</p>

<p>We now had plenty of time to kill. We decided to give Brian a call to meet for a
drink, but despite repeated attempts, we could not get his number to work. Dejected,
we went in search of food and drinks ourselves. While deciding among the many
restaurants in the tourist area I looked up to see a familiar face. I recognized
this guy from WCL and sitting next to him was Brian! Fate had interceded yet again!
Brian, Josh Keller (the guy I recognized, from WCL, but didn’t know by name) and
Ariel (someone we didn’t know at all at the time) finished their dinner at the
restaurant while Tom and I polished of some two dollar kabobs then we all headed out
for drinks. Tom and I took them back to the rooftop restaurant to enjoy the view we
had appreciated earlier.</p>

<p>Sitting in my sweat encrusted clothes and looking at my filthy feet and hands I
began to wonder…would it be appropriate to ask? My desire won over social
dictates. “Would you guys be willing to trade a ride to your hotel in our fabulous
ambulance for showers for our team?” It was clear we would get the better end of the bargain, but they agreed with good humor. An hour later they were bouncing along in Penny on the way to their hotel. As it turns out, their generosity extended not only
to letting use their shower, but also letting us sleep in their hotel room! Though
they may have thought they didn’t have much of a choice after I passed out on the end of the fold out cot.</p>

<p>After a restful night spent in a hotel room, we were ready to hit the road again. We attribute our speedy journey through Greece to the generosity of our WCL classmates.
Thanks guys!</p>
