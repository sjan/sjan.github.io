<p>We entered Mexico through Nogales on January 9th and exited at the boarder of&nbsp; Ciudad Hidalgo on February 9th.&nbsp; Mexico is a beautiful country with various climates and terrains.&nbsp; We drove through desserts, beach towns, plaines, and mountains.&nbsp; Our path started in a desert climate where temperature dropped below freezing at night, as we traveled southeast, we stopped by Hermosillo, Guaymas, the beautiful beach town Mazatlan in the green state of&nbsp; Sinaloa, small village Jala, the second largest city full of tasty foods Guadalajara, cultured San Luis Potosi, capital Mexico City, mole producing Oaxaca, and border city Tapachula.&nbsp; Altogether, we drove roughly 1900 miles in Mexico, stopped a fortnight unexpectedly due to car and health problems, had one teammate reunited with us, and one teammate decided to return home.<&#47;p>

<p>Taco seems to the consistent food throughout the country.&nbsp; Also, we have not visited any restaurant or food stand that didn&rsquo;t serve corn products.&nbsp; Grilled meat on some sort of corn wrap is most popular form of street food, taco, tostada, quesadilla, huarache, burrito, gordita, flaunt, and many more that I forgot the names of are all meat served on top or wrapped in some dough made with corn flour and then served with some kind of salsa.&nbsp; Up north, tacos are often made with hearty chunks of meat and selections of vegetables and salsas are served on the side, which is noticeable different from tacos in central&#47;south region where meat is marinated longer for flavors to soaked in and vegetables come on top of the taco. <&#47;p>

<p>People in the service industry have been very friendly and helpful.&nbsp; When our ambulance couldn&rsquo;t fit in a hotel&rsquo;s garage, recommendations for bigger garages else where were always given.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we were unable to find coin-operated laundry machines on the road, so I washed all the clothes by hand.&nbsp; <&#47;p>
<p>&nbsp;<&#47;p>
<p>Everyone had good times in Mexico, we have gone through one country, there are still 12 more countries to go.<&#47;p></p>
