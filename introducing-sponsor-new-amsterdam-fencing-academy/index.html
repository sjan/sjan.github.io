<p>Originally established in the year 2000 as Salle Gitane, NAFA has  grown from a handful of students into a constantly expanding, full-time  fencing club. NAFA has a distinctive program&#8212;modeled after some of the  most successful systems in Europe&#8212;that emphasizes group training along  with individual lessons. For kids, NAFA is a wonderful place to improve  fitness, develop mental acuity, and have fun. For adults, it is a great  place to learn a new sport or, for the experienced competitor, vastly  improve one&#8217;s abilities.<&#47;p></p>
