<p align="justify">As of 10AM this morning, UPS reported that our 20 lb shipment of car parts and pieces had arrived in Casablanca, Morocco. Getting a parcel from NJ to Casablanca in the span of 2 days is pretty impressive. I must extend a &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; to&#160; &ldquo;American Consumerism&rdquo; for demanding mail system that can route packages between airports efficiently and reliably. But here this is where the finger crossing begins. UPS&rsquo;s reliable service only extends so far as Casablanca. After that, we&rsquo;re at the mercy of the notoriously <strong>unreliable<&#47;strong> Moroccan Post.&#160; Colin said that if we&rsquo;re lucky, the parcel gets on a plane, arrives in Dakhla airport, and falls on our lap. The other route is for the package to be thrown onto a passenger bus bound for Dakhla, and that&rsquo;s a 2 day drive. UPS expects that our package should arrive by Monday. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll get it sooner.<&#47;p>

<p align="justify">I&rsquo;ve been told by some that Moroccans consider themselves European. On the other hand I recall meeting Moroccans in Rabat who had classed themselves as African. It&rsquo;s a bit confusing to me and really, and it&rsquo;s not my business to judge the Moroccan inferiority complex to Europe and superiority complex over Africa. But so long as Morocco can&rsquo;t get me my package in a timely fashion, I&rsquo;ll have to consider this place pretty backwater.<&#47;p>
