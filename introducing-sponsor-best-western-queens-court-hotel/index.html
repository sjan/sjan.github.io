<p>Best Western is one of the largest hotel chains in the world and we are proud to announce that one of the branches in New York have generously decided to sponsor us! Best Western Queens Court is located in Flushing, New York, a stone&#8217;s throw away from Shea Stadium and Arthur Ashe Stadium, where the annual US Open is held. You can be sure to expect some cool footage of us visiting Best Westerns across central Asia!<&#47;p></p>
