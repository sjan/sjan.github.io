<p>The ambulance was rolled into Marrakesh on a flatbed truck with a broken differential housing and a busted universal cross joint. Five days later, the ambulance hobbled out of Marrakesh with a non-functioning speedometer and a f&rsquo;d up transmission.
<div style="display: none"><a href='http:&#47;&#47;buycialisonline11.com&#47;' title='buy cialis online'>buy cialis online<&#47;a><&#47;div> We all bade Marrakesh good riddance and were looking forward to the next destination which could only better, even if it was a latrine smelling gas station. <&#47;p></p>
<p>The rally organizers gave us two &ldquo;important&rdquo; safety rules: <&#47;p></p>
<ol>
<li>NO night driving in Africa. <&#47;li>
<li>NO driving through Mauritania alone. <&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
<p>To emphasize point #2, the organizer had hired a guide to take the teams through Mauritania. A military escort was scheduled to meet the teams at 9:00AM on December 29th. The border was 2000km, 20 hours away. We left Marrakesh at 3:00PM, December 28. If we drove without stopping at all, and Google maps was correct, then we&rsquo;d get there at only 1 hour late. Reaching the convoy without driving through the night would be impossible.<&#47;p></p>
<p align="left">I drove the 1:30AM &ndash; 8:00AM shift starting from somewhere before Layonne, to nowhere after Boujdour.&#160; Share two narrow lanes with incoming truck traffic in pitch black darkness is a bit harrowing, but at least the roads were paved and lanes actually existed. We did our best to reach the border and the other teams. At around 7:00AM, we were pretty sure that we weren&rsquo;t going to make it. Team Last Responders would be violating both safety tips.<&#47;p></p>
