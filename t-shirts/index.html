<p>It's high time we got some t-shirts! We're going to be offering them for $20, with 100% of the proceeds going towards ambulance donation funding. There are lots of hurdles to overcome in donating a vehicle to Africa, as we're learning. Things like maintenance, shipping, and lots of fuel stand between New York and Mali. Apart from that we aim to donate actual money and not an ambulance alone.</p>
<p>We'll be ordering two different color T-Shirts in lightweight 100% cotton (Sizes S, M, L, XL). However if you pre-order one you'll be able to choose any color you want! Below are just some suggested color combinations but if you'd like something you don't see there, like royal blue or aubergine or anything, we can do that too. You also have a chance to get a striped sleeve jersey, which we won't be offering later. (Striped Sleeve Jersey only available with white ink, as pictured.)</p>
<p>To place an order just post a reply to this post or comment on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com&#47;notes&#47;team-last-responders&#47;reserve-your-team-t-shirt&#47;253065841399464">Team Last Responders Facebook page<&#47;a> ! (Or contact Mike, Stephen, Kunal, or Dennis directly.) Please specify shirt color, ink color, and size. (We're not taking any money until you have the shirt in hand.)</p>
