<p>Entering Morocco through Tangiers took several hours. The processes was obviously very different from European border crossings (at least for Americans): long queues, shuffling here and there, everything happening at the whim of some border official. It reminded me of border crossings beyond Turkey on the Mongol Rally.<&#47;p></p>
<p>The procedure: <&#47;p></p>
<ol>
<li>Find your way to the front of the line (orderly or not orderly, just get there) <&#47;li>
<li>Get the attention of the border official <&#47;li>
<li>Fill out a green form. (Customs for the car) <&#47;li>
<li>Get the attention of the border official and he&rsquo;ll scribble something on the form, stamp it, and throw it into the stack of green slips <&#47;li>
<li>Get directed to the police and they&rsquo;ll enter you into some computer. <&#47;li>
<li>Wait a while. <&#47;li>
<li>Get the attention of the border official and maybe he&rsquo;ll push your paperwork along. <&#47;li>
<li>Eventually paperwork is completed <&#47;li>
<li>Take the car over to the next line of cars <&#47;li>
<li>Exchange some money <&#47;li>
<li>Fight your way to the front of one of four car insurance booths. (requires extreme patience and tenacity) <&#47;li>
<li>Buy car insurance for 10 days. <&#47;li>
<li>done <&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>

<p>Since I had the most experience dealing with borders, I dealt with the border official. Once we got past that first phase, Kunal decided to brave the insurance line.<&#47;p></p>

<&#47;p></p>
<p>The whole processes took a couple hours. It take a bit of patience but was relatively painless.<&#47;p></p>
