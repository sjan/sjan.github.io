<p>With our car troubles behind us, we were looking forward to smooth sailing to Phoenix Arizona.<br />
The drive would take us across Texas, through a corner of New Mexico, and plunge us into the heart of Arizona.</p>

<p> We pulled into the Eunice, New Mexico, Allsup's parking lot sometime around 1AM to stop for the day. Unable to stay sleeping in the freezing cold, I woke up at around 6AM and to loiter in the shop to keep warm. The talkative cashier lady asked me what I was doing there. I told her I was waiting for my team to wake up. She asked me where we were headed. I spent a moment to describe our project to donate an ambulance to South America. Her reply was "Oh you're hippies!". </p>

Carlsbad Cavern is a national park founded some distant past. I had never heard of it until Mike brought it up. We took the car up a narrow but scenic trail to the mountaintop visitors center. The cavern was pretty cool, you can hike to the depths of it and back out, which takes a couple hours. But if you're smart, you'd just take the elevator. </p>

<p>While you're up there, food options are pretty limited. The cafeteria entices visitors by proudly brandishing samples of "local" cuisine. I'm surprised that there is such a thing atop a mountain but who am I to judge? Apparently locals eat quesadillas, burgers, and hot dogs. I ate locally opened tinned sardines a la instant noodles. I drank locally brewed and ground coffee that I brought from New York. </p>

<p>In New York, many BBQ joints tout their authenticity by drawing roots back to the south, like Texas. El Paso was 2 hours from Carlsbad Caverns so we naturally had to stop and find a BBQ joint. According the radio station KLAQ, Rudy's BBQ got a thumbs up. We weren't disappointed. At Rudy's (http:&#47;&#47;www.rudysbbq.com&#47;) brisket and ribs are ordered by the pound. If you've ever been to Hill Country (http:&#47;&#47;www.hillcountryny.com&#47;) on 26th St, you'll be familiar with the way it works. For seven dollars, Mike somehow managed to pick up a feast including half a chicken, 2 sides of beans and complimentary rice crispy treats. The Rudy's BBQ stop was a definite win. </p>
