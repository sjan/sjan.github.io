Colin use to run a trucking company. Back then, he employed Hassan as the primary mechanic. According to Colin, when it comes to fixing trucks Hassan&rsquo;s your man - trustworthy, loyal, and much more competent than any of those swindling Moroccan mechanics from Marrakesh. On New Year&rsquo;s Day 2012, a Sunday, at around&#160; 2:00pm Hassan got a phone call about a certain Ford 350 ambulance with a transmission problem. By 3:00pm Hassan showed up at Colin&rsquo;s place ready to examine the car. I can&rsquo;t imagine a mechanic in the USA opening his shop on Sunday, New Year&rsquo;s day like that. But Colin&rsquo;s one of those people with the type of mysterious backgrounds that can make these things happen.<&#47;p>

<p>We dropped off the ambulance at Hassan&rsquo;s and once again turned Colin&rsquo;s living room into our internet Caf&eacute;.<&#47;p>
