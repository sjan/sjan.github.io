<p align="justify">Dakhla sits on a 50km peninsula that cuts along the Atlantic ocean and is the last big city before Mauritania. Perhaps &ldquo;big city&rdquo; is a bit misleading. I should say, Dakhla is the last black dot on a blue line on our map before the Mauritanian border. <&#47;p>
<p align="justify">As we neared the city, we came up upon another military checkpoint &ndash; three guys in neat grey uniforms asked for passports and three questions in the same order: Where are you going? Where are you coming from?<&#47;p><br />

<p>What is you occupation? We printed all this on a sheet of paper called a fiche on which Dennis wrote &ldquo;Fencing Coach&rdquo;, to be unique and smart. A word of advice for future Timbuktu ralliers. If you don&rsquo;t want spend 30 minutes explaining your job to corrupt police officers without the aid of language at every check point then make sure you have&#160; a boring job, or just lie about it. Be like Mike and me: Artist and Engineer.<&#47;p>  </p>
<p align="justify">Now Dennis doesn&rsquo;t speak French and the soldiers don&rsquo;t speak English. Living out in the desert, they haven&rsquo;t ever seen fencing. Every soldier that comes across &ldquo;fencing coach&rdquo; asks for an explanation. So&#160; for every explanation, Dennis gets into a silly en guard position, hops around, and makes poking movements with his finger, all the while repeating &ldquo;escrima? escrima? coach? coach?&rdquo;. Fantastic stuff.<&#47;p><br />

<p align="justify">Pulling into Dakhla felt like pulling into a Caribbean beach town. Locals walked in sandals, shorts and colorful jalabas.&#160; European RV&rsquo;s, land cruisers roamed the streets and surfers milled around in sunglasses. The weather was moderate and pleasant, I felt like we found an oasis in the middle of the desert.<&#47;p><br />

<p>We were all pretty dirty and disgusting by now. Me being the only one who hadn&rsquo;t showered once since entering Africa 11 days ago, I was probably the worst. The Sahara Regency offered western accommodations for western prices: 600Dh for a single room and 800Dh for a double room. It&rsquo;s offerings were probably no better than your run of the mill Holiday Inn off route 95 but here in Western Sahara, it proudly brandished four stars. <&#47;p>  </p>
<p align="justify">Over lunch, we debated taking the Sahara Regency, renting a flat for 350Dh for one night, or spending more time searching for another hotel. Instead of all that, in an interesting turn of events, we happened upon a very special individual: Frey McCall. Frey ad Dakhla McCall, as she is known on Facebook, sent us a message about a month ago before we left for the rally. We had no idea who she was or what she wanted, but when we called her from the caf&eacute;, it turned out she was at the same restaurant, downstairs. She invited us over to her flat and completely shaped out Dakhla experience in the Western Sahara.<&#47;p><br />
