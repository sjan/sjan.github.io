<p>I&#8217;ve just arrived in Berlin. I&#8217;m here to check out the ambulance that we will acquire to donate to Mongolia. The deadline to submit car registration information is May 31st so I have about ten days to figure everything out. I&#8217;ve given myself about one week to check&nbsp; the car (make sure it exists), make the purchase and plan the next move.<&#47;p></p>
