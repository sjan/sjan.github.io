<p>Arrived in Berlin to mild temperature. Apparently I missed the 100+ degree heat wave - whew. Finally took the car for a joy ride and it&#8217;s a pretty sweet feeling. We have plenty of space in the back and front. I&#8217;m totally looking forward to seeing the other team&#8217;s cars in London. Now we have to head over to Autotip (German Autozone) to pickup some spare wheels and batteries and other items we won&#8217;t be able to find in Mongolia. After that, food shopping, and then we&#8217;re off to London!<&#47;p></p>
