<p>Traveling through Uzbekistan requires Uzbek visas. According to the Uzbek embassy website, imperialist Americans representatives pay a premium for a visa that generally much cheaper for non-Americans. On the other hand, a transit visas cost only $20. Given that we&#8217;re all pretty broke, we decided to find out from the embassy exactly who we&#8217;d have to bribe to get a transit visa.<&#47;p></p>

<p>After an unproductive visit to the Uzbek embassy that turned out to be open only 2 hours out of the day, we stopped by the Azerbaijan Embassy. When we arrived, like Uzbekistan, the sign stated that they worked only 2 hours out of the day which totally bummed us out. But as we were about to leave, this thin, Central Asian looking man dressed in T-shirt and slacks washing this black Cadillac told us that the consulate door was open and that we should just go in. Once inside, we immediately ran into 2 men in the back office with  &#8220;Who the hell are these people?&#8221; written all over their faces.<&#47;p></p>
