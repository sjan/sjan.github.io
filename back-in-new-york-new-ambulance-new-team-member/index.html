<p>I&#8217;ve returned to New York after a week long visit to Berlin. Mission Ambulance Acquisition was simple: check, purchase, and register the car. What ended up happening was completely unexpected - ending with an emergency train ticket back to Berlin from Leipzig, a delayed flight out of Berlin, and the airport ground crew going on strike, causing my luggage to be misplaced.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;d like to report that we backed out of Lenon, the original car that we&#8217;ve decided to get. We ended up selecting a different, older, yet to be named, better maintained car. I&#8217;d also like to report that we have a new Team Member: Lillian Wilde!<&#47;p></p>
<p>In other news:<&#47;p></p>
<p>Unfortunately due to some issues with the Tshirt printers, the pre-production samples never arrived. Looks like the Tshirts will be delay a week.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Right now we&#8217;re scrambling to get visas, to finish the purchase, and to raise funds. We&#8217;ve all dropped off our applications to the Kazakhstan Visa. Mine is scheduled to be ready by Tuesday.<&#47;p></p>
