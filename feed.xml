        <title>Everything is Perfect at Home</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; We were all rushed onto the plane in Lima, and I had to use the bathroom before the plane took off.&amp;nbsp; I was so very happy that the toilet paper can be flushed down the toilet.&lt;&amp;#47;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; By the time we landed in Florida, everybody spoke English,&amp;nbsp; I understood every word of every conversation, all the signs were familiar too.&lt;&amp;#47;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; It took about 3 minutes to re-connect my cellphone.&amp;nbsp; I got my unlimited LTE network back while waiting for my connecting flight.&lt;&amp;#47;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; When I finally arrived in Baltimore and met my mom at the baggage claim, my first word was, &amp;ldquo;mama.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; My mom said, &amp;ldquo;Oh, you didn&amp;rsquo;t lose any weight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;&amp;#47;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; I slept on my full size bed with soft clean sheets I chose and purchased to my liking.&amp;nbsp; I have my own bed, my own bedroom, my own bathroom, my own study, no need to share anymore.&lt;&amp;#47;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; I showered as long as I wanted, applied conditioner on my hair and even had a facial mask.&amp;nbsp; The next day, I showered twice, in fact, I can shower as many times as I want.&lt;&amp;#47;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.&amp;nbsp; I have plenty of clean clothes.&lt;&amp;#47;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.&amp;nbsp; 回家后第一顿饭吃的是凉瓜，皮蛋拌豆腐等清爽的小菜。吃饭的时候，面上无事，心里很感慨呀。然后第二天买了一条活鱼回来，总算吃到了真正的新鲜鱼。&lt;&amp;#47;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;rsquo;ll get to see all of you who supported us.&amp;nbsp; Thank you for everything.&lt;&amp;#47;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Far is My Dream?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&amp;#47;&amp;#47;lastresponders.org&amp;#47;wp-content&amp;#47;uploads&amp;#47;2014&amp;#47;04&amp;#47;stars.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;padding-top: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;border-width: 0px&quot; title=&quot;stars&quot; alt=&quot;stars&quot; src=&quot;http:&amp;#47;&amp;#47;lastresponders.org&amp;#47;wp-content&amp;#47;uploads&amp;#47;2014&amp;#47;04&amp;#47;stars_thumb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1028&quot; height=&quot;685&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; &amp;#47;&gt;&lt;&amp;#47;a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took this picture on the high mountains roughly 30 miles north of Camargo, Bolivia.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether I had the Milky Way or a nebula,&amp;nbsp; all I knew was that I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to see this at home because stars of the southern hemisphere are different from the northern hemisphere.&amp;nbsp; At the time, we were driving thousands of meters above the sea level on dangerous curvy mountain roads, there were a couple of street lamps distanced away, cars passed by very rarely on the road.&amp;nbsp; I requested to stop for pictures, the moment I opened the passenger door of the ambulance, I saw the night sky I&amp;rsquo;ve dreamed of for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by heavenly bodies. My first attempt to photograph the moon was about ten years ago, using my first digital camera, the pocket sized Casio Exilim.&amp;nbsp; The Casio Exilim had some manual settings which allowed me to do long exposures on a tripod for night scenes, but unfortunately, the moon didn&amp;rsquo;t come out well.&amp;nbsp; Since then, I failed a few more times to capture the moon and the stars as I had hoped.&amp;nbsp; The moon was my trials of failures before success, just before this trip, I borrowed my dad&amp;rsquo;s Nikon D700 and took a couple of satisfying pictures of the moon.&amp;nbsp; The Milky Way, on the other hand, has been a fantasy that I only saw in textbooks and online tutorials.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;ve never even seen the Milky Way with my own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment I stepped out of the car, I knew that a dream was coming true, I walked into the phantom night sky shown on textbooks and NASA pictures.&amp;nbsp; Immediately, I fetched the camera and the tripod, it was my chance to produce a textbook picture!&amp;nbsp; When I took this picture, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see anything through the view finder because it was too dark.&amp;nbsp; I aimed at a section of the sky and pressed the shutter, 30 seconds later, I discovered what the picture looked like, then adjusted the camera settings and the angle of the camera to try again.&amp;nbsp; While I gazed at the millions of stars, waiting for the exposure to finish, I wished for a wider lens which could get more coverage, I wished for our more experienced photographer Mike to be here, maybe Mike would have a clever way to position the camera to get the village at the far horizon.&amp;nbsp; There were no shooting stars to grant my wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few shots I realized my lens was only able to capture a small fraction of the grandiose sky, nonetheless, a small fraction was enough to produce my splendid picture.&amp;nbsp; A more experienced photographer with better equipment would definitely be able to compose a more gorgeous shot, but when nature is so magnificent, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much talent to produce a great picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my picture only demonstrates 20% of nature&amp;rsquo;s greatness, maybe a more professional photographer would be twice as good, but no pictures or words can do nature justice.&amp;nbsp; You must stand high above the sea level, breath in diluted oxygen, and feel the cold breeze in the quiet darkness to live our stargazing experience.&amp;nbsp; It is not humanly possible to replicate this fantastic moment.&amp;nbsp; We can share our pictures and videos, tell our stories, but we cannot bring anyone to live the experience, you must adventure out there yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We resigned from our jobs, drove ten thousand miles and traveled four months on the road, then of all a sudden, one night, I stepped out of the vehicle and realized my long cherished dream.&amp;nbsp; Sounds very amazing, right?&amp;nbsp; I stared at this picture for a while in solitude (please understand that to be in solitude is very had for me, I&amp;rsquo;m now used to eating, sleeping, and doing almost everything accompanied by someone else) and questioned myself what it really takes for me to produce something like this.&amp;nbsp; First, I need a camera with long exposure capability, that&amp;rsquo;s not hard, I have many friends with good cameras and lenses.&amp;nbsp; Then, I need to go to a place to take this picture.&amp;nbsp; For at least 3 years, I knew Cherry Springs State Park in Pennsylvania is famous for stargazing, and this state park is about 4 or 5 hours away from Manhattan.&amp;nbsp; Well, so what does it take to borrow a camera, rent a car, and drive there to take pictures?&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s one day&amp;rsquo;s work?&amp;nbsp; Make two days?&amp;nbsp; Why didn&amp;rsquo;t I go?&amp;nbsp; On a chilly clear night, way up high in the Bolivian mountains, I realized that perhaps some dreams were never too far away, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t chase them.&lt;/p&gt;
