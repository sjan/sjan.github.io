<p>When I signed up for Mongol Rally I knew that I would need at least a  five weeks to complete the journey. Unfortunately, the start date for  Mongol Rally is July 23 meaning we will finish, at the earliest, around  the end of August. But school starts on August 23&#8212;around the time we  expect to be in Kazakhstan! This is when I began plotting how to get out  of going back to school in Washington, D.C. My grand plan&#8212;go to law  school somewhere else.<&#47;p></p>
<p>After endless paperwork, numerous harassing phone calls to Washington  College of Law&#8217;s administration, and months of worry, I will be studying  law in Barcelona, Spain during the fall semester. Conveniently, ESADE  Law School&#8217;s start date is mid-September, which should give me just  enough time to reach Mongolia and then trek back to Spain. Now I can  officially participate in Mongol Rally without being a law school  dropout. Phew, If I am lucky, Stephen will agree to drive me to  Barcelona in the MMMobile!<&#47;p></p>
