<p><span> <&#47;span>MMMT  is in&nbsp;full fledged visa application mode. All of us were able to obtain  a visa for Turkmenistan and we are now working on getting our visas  for&nbsp;Kazakhstan. Stephen is flying to Berlin as I write to scout out the  Magical Mongolian Mystery Mobile. We need to register it with The  Adventurists by May 31 otherwise we are walking to Mongolia, so right  now our fate rests with Stephen&#8217;s success&#8230;<&#47;p></p>
<p><span> <&#47;span><span> <&#47;span>In  other exciting news,&nbsp;Tom and I just finished our 2L year at American  University Washington College of Law! Well, sort of. Tom is taking a  bunch of classes over the summer so that he can finish all his U.S. law  school requirements before starting law school in Paris. I was supposed  to write a paper for one of my classes to fulfill my writing requirement  for graduation, but Mongol Rally got in the way. I got an extension so  that I can &#8220;complete&#8221; it over the summer. How much have I written? 0 out  of 40 pages. Woops! But I am sure I can write a 40 page paper, work  full-time, and get everything together for 6 months abroad in the next  10 weeks!<&#47;p></p>
