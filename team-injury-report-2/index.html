<p>It&#8217;s time for another injury report. Judy came down with something, a  bug of some sort over night, and woke up this morning feeling dizzy,  weak, and exhausted. She ate healthily throughout the day, drank lots of  fluids, and relaxed. Citrus fruits became a large part of her diet. She  is working vigorously (while relaxing) to nurse herself back to good  health, looked stronger tonight, and should be golden tomorrow or the  next day.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Stephen is in New York, and the author of this post is unaware of his  health status, although he appears to be in good health. Stephen will  travel to Washington, D.C. this weekend for a fencing tournament, which  Judy and Tom plan to attend for team support and bonding. This weekend,  the trio will most likely discuss more details, post more blogs, get  healthy together over some beers or vicodin in Tom&#8217;s case, and plant a  garden at the Porter House (1924).<&#47;p></p>
<p>Tom will soon post before surgery, or BS, pictures of his nose and face.  Tom cannot breath out of either nostrel and has a very crooked, broken,  and battered nose. Not for beauty but for health, Tom will go under the  knife later this morning, undergoing a full rhinoplasty, two-hour long  cosmetic surgery to fix his nose&#8230; to right the ship so to speak which  is now protruding oddly from his face. Tom has an appointment for  digital imaging at 7:30 am eastern standard time, when the doctor and  surgeon will computerize how the nose will be shaped. T&#8217; Twittle then  has a noon out-patient, anesthetized surgery which should last  approximately two hours if all goes well. Post-operation (PO) pictures -  splint, blood, gauze, and all to follow as well. TommyD will be  recovering at the Porter House with vicodin and anti-biotics while  watching episodes of Man v. Wild, 24, House, and the new show on HBO  about post-Katrina New Orleans.<&#47;p></p>
<p>It&#8217;s crunch time near finals time here in D.C., so it&#8217;s time to get back  to some work.<&#47;p></p>
<p>So, there you have it&#8230; our team is a little dinged up right now, but  that&#8217;s certainly not going to stop us. WE may slow down a bit here these  next few days, but much work and excitement to come. peace y&#8217;all.<&#47;p></p>
