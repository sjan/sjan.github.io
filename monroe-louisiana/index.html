<p>According to the wiki, Monroe is the eighth largest city in the state of Louisiana, it was where my mom first landed in the US.&nbsp; When I was about 4 or 5, my mom left China to obtain her master&rsquo;s degree in education at what is now called Louisiana State University.&nbsp; She was a couple of years older than I am now, all she had were 2 suitcases and $200 in her pocket.&nbsp; Mom never returned to Monroe after she finished her study, but I have heard of this&nbsp; city countless number of times since I moved to the US in the early 90&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The team decided to take a detour and see what Monroe is like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After we dropped off Paul at the New Orleans airport, the team took the country roads to Monroe on a sunny winter day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were pretty hungry when we arrived, but many local restaurants close after lunch and before dinner.</p>

<p>For reasons unknown, I decided not to visit mom&rsquo;s old school, instead I wanted to see what the town is like.&nbsp; The team split in two ways, Steve and I took the support vehicle to explore in town while the rest of the team went to Wal-Mart in the ambulance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our first stop was a church.&nbsp; My mom was baptized in Monroe.&nbsp; Over the years, I have struggled to find faith; I have always been harsh to missionaries who came knocking on our doors.&nbsp; In the back of my mind, I always thought that my mom turned to a church only because she felt vulnerable in a totally new environment.&nbsp; She has never attended any religious service since I reunited with her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the church visit, we stopped by a random meat market, there was a convenience store next door, which seemed to be a gathering place for teenagers.&nbsp; For a while, I felt like it&nbsp; was a step back in time.&nbsp; I imaged that the meat market, the convenience store, and things around them are same as they were when my mom was here.&nbsp; This place has not changed much in the past 20 or so years.</p>
<p>The type face of the font on the outside wall, the black and white boards, counters, freezers, and everything else appeared to be 20 or 30 years old.</p>

<p>Customers in the convenient store looked like actors from a 70&rsquo;s or 80&rsquo;s movie&rsquo;s set.</p>

<p>Steve stood out in this placed lost in time.&nbsp; Locals were extremely friendly to us.&nbsp; Someone asked if we belonged to a TV station&hellip;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the team wasn&rsquo;t interested in exploring around.&nbsp; Martha and Stephen Alexis were dancing on the top of our ambulance when we returned.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our visit in Monroe was really brief, perhaps I&rsquo;d come back again and bike around for a couple of days, or maybe I should have gone to the university.&nbsp; Anyways, I probably would not end up in Monroe Louisiana if I didn&rsquo;t take on this journey to South America, I&rsquo;m glad we came.</p>
