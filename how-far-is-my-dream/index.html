<p>I took this picture on the high mountains roughly 30 miles north of Camargo, Bolivia.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure whether I had the Milky Way or a nebula,&nbsp; all I knew was that I won&rsquo;t be able to see this at home because stars of the southern hemisphere are different from the northern hemisphere.&nbsp; At the time, we were driving thousands of meters above the sea level on dangerous curvy mountain roads, there were a couple of street lamps distanced away, cars passed by very rarely on the road.&nbsp; I requested to stop for pictures, the moment I opened the passenger door of the ambulance, I saw the night sky I&rsquo;ve dreamed of for years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by heavenly bodies. My first attempt to photograph the moon was about ten years ago, using my first digital camera, the pocket sized Casio Exilim.&nbsp; The Casio Exilim had some manual settings which allowed me to do long exposures on a tripod for night scenes, but unfortunately, the moon didn&rsquo;t come out well.&nbsp; Since then, I failed a few more times to capture the moon and the stars as I had hoped.&nbsp; The moon was my trials of failures before success, just before this trip, I borrowed my dad&rsquo;s Nikon D700 and took a couple of satisfying pictures of the moon.&nbsp; The Milky Way, on the other hand, has been a fantasy that I only saw in textbooks and online tutorials.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never even seen the Milky Way with my own eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The moment I stepped out of the car, I knew that a dream was coming true, I walked into the phantom night sky shown on textbooks and NASA pictures.&nbsp; Immediately, I fetched the camera and the tripod, it was my chance to produce a textbook picture!&nbsp; When I took this picture, I couldn&rsquo;t see anything through the view finder because it was too dark.&nbsp; I aimed at a section of the sky and pressed the shutter, 30 seconds later, I discovered what the picture looked like, then adjusted the camera settings and the angle of the camera to try again.&nbsp; While I gazed at the millions of stars, waiting for the exposure to finish, I wished for a wider lens which could get more coverage, I wished for our more experienced photographer Mike to be here, maybe Mike would have a clever way to position the camera to get the village at the far horizon.&nbsp; There were no shooting stars to grant my wishes.</p>
<p>After a few shots I realized my lens was only able to capture a small fraction of the grandiose sky, nonetheless, a small fraction was enough to produce my splendid picture.&nbsp; A more experienced photographer with better equipment would definitely be able to compose a more gorgeous shot, but when nature is so magnificent, it doesn&rsquo;t take much talent to produce a great picture.</p>
<p>Perhaps my picture only demonstrates 20% of nature&rsquo;s greatness, maybe a more professional photographer would be twice as good, but no pictures or words can do nature justice.&nbsp; You must stand high above the sea level, breath in diluted oxygen, and feel the cold breeze in the quiet darkness to live our stargazing experience.&nbsp; It is not humanly possible to replicate this fantastic moment.&nbsp; We can share our pictures and videos, tell our stories, but we cannot bring anyone to live the experience, you must adventure out there yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We resigned from our jobs, drove ten thousand miles and traveled four months on the road, then of all a sudden, one night, I stepped out of the vehicle and realized my long cherished dream.&nbsp; Sounds very amazing, right?&nbsp; I stared at this picture for a while in solitude (please understand that to be in solitude is very had for me, I&rsquo;m now used to eating, sleeping, and doing almost everything accompanied by someone else) and questioned myself what it really takes for me to produce something like this.&nbsp; First, I need a camera with long exposure capability, that&rsquo;s not hard, I have many friends with good cameras and lenses.&nbsp; Then, I need to go to a place to take this picture.&nbsp; For at least 3 years, I knew Cherry Springs State Park in Pennsylvania is famous for stargazing, and this state park is about 4 or 5 hours away from Manhattan.&nbsp; Well, so what does it take to borrow a camera, rent a car, and drive there to take pictures?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s one day&rsquo;s work?&nbsp; Make two days?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t I go?&nbsp; On a chilly clear night, way up high in the Bolivian mountains, I realized that perhaps some dreams were never too far away, I just didn&rsquo;t chase them.</p>
